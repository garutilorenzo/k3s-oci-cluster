### Important notes

* This is repo shows only how to use terraform with the Oracle Cloud infrastructure and use only the **always free** resources. This examples are **not** for a production environment.
* At the end of your trial period (30 days). All the paid resources deployed will be stopped/terminated
* At the end of your trial period (30 days), if you have a running compute instance it will be stopped/hibernated

### Requirements

To use this repo you will need:

* an Oracle Cloud account. You can register [here](https://cloud.oracle.com)

Once you get the account, follow the *Before you begin* and *1. Prepare* step in [this](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/tf-provider/01-summary.htm) document.

### Supported OS

This module was tested with:

* Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 (ubuntu remote user)
* Oracle Linux 8, 9 (opc remote user)

### Terraform OCI user creation (Optional)

Is always recommended to create a separate user an group to use with Terraform. This user must have less privileges possible (Zero trust policy). This is an example policy that allow *terraform-group* to manage all the resources needed by this module:

```
Allow group terraform-group to manage virtual-network-family  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage instance-family  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage compute-management-family  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage volume-family  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage load-balancers  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage network-load-balancers  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage dynamic-groups in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to manage policies in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
Allow group terraform-group to read network-load-balancers  in compartment id <compartment_ocid>
```

See [how](#oracle-provider-setup) to find the compartment ocid. The user and the group have to be manually created before using this module.
To create the user go to Identity & Security -> Users, then create the group in Identity & Security -> Groups and associate the newly created user to the group. The last step is to create the policy in Identity & Security -> Policies.

#### Example RSA key generation

To use terraform with the Oracle Cloud infrastructure you need to generate an RSA key. Generate the rsa key with:

```
openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud.pem 4096
chmod 600 ~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud.pem
openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud.pem -out ~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud_public.pem
```

replace *<your_name>* with your name or a string you prefer.

**NOTE** ~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud_public.pem this string will be used on the *terraform.tfvars* used by the Oracle provider plugin, so please take note of this string.

### Project setup

Clone this repo and go in the *example/* directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster.git
cd k3s-oci-cluster/example/
```

Now you have to edit the *main.tf* file and you have to create the *terraform.tfvars* file. For more detail see [Oracle provider setup](#oracle-provider-setup) and [Pre flight checklist](#pre-flight-checklist).

Or if you prefer you can create an new empty directory in your workspace and create this three files:

* terraform.tfvars - More details in [Oracle provider setup](#oracle-provider-setup)
* main.tf
* provider.tf

The main.tf file will look like:


```
variable "compartment_ocid" {

}

variable "tenancy_ocid" {

}

variable "user_ocid" {

}

variable "fingerprint" {

}

variable "private_key_path" {

}

variable "region" {
  default = "<change_me>"
}

module "k3s_cluster" {
  region              = var.region
  availability_domain = "<change_me>"
  compartment_ocid    = var.compartment_ocid
  my_public_ip_cidr   = "<change_me>"
  cluster_name        = "<change_me>"
  environment         = "staging"
  source              = "github.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster"
}

output "k3s_servers_ips" {
  value = module.k3s_cluster.k3s_servers_ips
}

output "k3s_workers_ips" {
  value = module.k3s_cluster.k3s_workers_ips
}

output "public_lb_ip" {
  value = module.k3s_cluster.public_lb_ip
}
```

For all the possible variables see [Pre flight checklist](#pre-flight-checklist)

The provider.tf will look like:

```
provider "oci" {
  tenancy_ocid     = var.tenancy_ocid
  user_ocid        = var.user_ocid
  private_key_path = var.private_key_path
  fingerprint      = var.fingerprint
  region           = var.region
}
```

Now we can init terraform with:

```
terraform init

terraform init
Initializing modules...
Downloading git::https://github.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster.git for k3s_cluster...
- k3s_cluster in .terraform/modules/k3s_cluster

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/oci from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/template from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/template v2.2.0
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/oci v4.64.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

### Oracle provider setup

In the *example/* directory of this repo you need to create a terraform.tfvars file, the file will look like:

```
fingerprint      = "<rsa_key_fingerprint>"
private_key_path = "~/.oci/<your_name>-oracle-cloud_public.pem"
user_ocid        = "<user_ocid>"
tenancy_ocid     = "<tenency_ocid>"
compartment_ocid = "<compartment_ocid>"
```

To find your tenency_ocid in the Ocacle Cloud console go to: Governance and Administration > Tenency details, then copy the OCID.

To find you user_ocid in the Ocacle Cloud console go to User setting (click on the icon in the top right corner, then click on User settings), click your username and then copy the OCID

The compartment_ocid is the same as tenency_ocid.

The fingerprint is the fingerprint of your RSA key, you can find this vale under User setting > API Keys

#### How to find the availability doamin name

To find the list of the availability domains run this command on che Cloud Shell:

```
oci iam availability-domain list
{
  "data": [
    {
      "compartment-id": "<compartment_ocid>",
      "id": "ocid1.availabilitydomain.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "iAdc:EU-ZURICH-1-AD-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### How to list all the OS images

To filter the OS images by shape and OS run this command on che Cloud Shell. You can filter by OS: Canonical Ubuntu or Oracle Linux:

```
oci compute image list --compartment-id <compartment_ocid> --operating-system "Canonical Ubuntu" --shape "VM.Standard.A1.Flex"
{
  "data": [
    {
      "agent-features": null,
      "base-image-id": null,
      "billable-size-in-gbs": 2,
      "compartment-id": null,
      "create-image-allowed": true,
      "defined-tags": {},
      "display-name": "Canonical-Ubuntu-20.04-aarch64-2022.01.18-0",
      "freeform-tags": {},
      "id": "ocid1.image.oc1.eu-zurich-1.aaaaaaaag2uyozo7266bmg26j5ixvi42jhaujso2pddpsigtib6vfnqy5f6q",
      "launch-mode": "NATIVE",
      "launch-options": {
        "boot-volume-type": "PARAVIRTUALIZED",
        "firmware": "UEFI_64",
        "is-consistent-volume-naming-enabled": true,
        "is-pv-encryption-in-transit-enabled": true,
        "network-type": "PARAVIRTUALIZED",
        "remote-data-volume-type": "PARAVIRTUALIZED"
      },
      "lifecycle-state": "AVAILABLE",
      "listing-type": null,
      "operating-system": "Canonical Ubuntu",
      "operating-system-version": "20.04",
      "size-in-mbs": 47694,
      "time-created": "2022-01-27T22:53:34.270000+00:00"
    },
```

## Notes about OCI always free resources

In order to get the maximum resources available within the oracle always free tier, the max amount of the k3s servers and k3s workers must be 2. So the max value for *k3s_server_pool_size* and *k3s_worker_pool_size* **is** 2.

In this setup we use two LB, one internal LB and one public LB (Layer 7). In order to use two LB using the always free resources, one lb must be a [network load balancer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/NetworkLoadBalancer/introducton.htm#Overview) an the other must be a [load balancer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Balance/Concepts/balanceoverview.htm). The public LB **must** use the *flexible* shape (*public_lb_shape* variable).

## Notes about K3s

In this environment the High Availability of the K3s cluster is provided using the Embedded DB. More details [here](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/)

The default installation of K3s install [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) as ingress the controller. In this environment Traefik is replaced by [Nginx ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/). To install Traefik as the ingress controller set the variable *install_nginx_ingress* to *false*.
For more details on Nginx ingress controller see the [Nginx ingress controller](#nginxingress-controller) section.

## Infrastructure overview

The final infrastructure will be made by:

* two instance pool:
  * one instance pool for the server nodes named "k3s-servers"
  * one instance pool for the worker nodes named "k3s-workers"
* one internal load balancer that will route traffic to K3s servers
* one external load balancer that will route traffic to K3s workers

The other resources created by terraform are:

* two instance configurations (one for the servers and one for the workers) used by the instance pools
* one vcn
* two public subnets
* two security list
* one dynamic group
* one identity policy

![k3s infra](https://garutilorenzo.github.io/images/k3s-oci-always-free.drawio.png?)

## Cluster resource deployed

This setup will automatically install [longhorn](https://longhorn.io/). Longhorn is a *Cloud native distributed block storage for Kubernetes*. To disable the longhorn deployment set *install_longhorn* variable to *false*

**NOTE** to use longhorn set the *k3s_version* < v1.25.x [Ref.](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003)

### Nginx ingress controller

In this environment [Nginx ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) is used instead of the standard [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) ingress controller.

The installation is the [bare metal](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#bare-metal-clusters) installation, the ingress controller then is exposed via a NodePort Service.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx-controller-loadbalancer
  namespace: ingress-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: ${nginx_ingress_controller_http_nodeport} # default to 30080
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 443
      nodePort: ${nginx_ingress_controller_https_nodeport} # default to 30443
  type: NodePort
```

To get the real ip address of the clients using a public L4 load balancer we need to use the proxy protocol feature of nginx ingress controller:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  allow-snippet-annotations: "true"
  enable-real-ip: "true"
  proxy-real-ip-cidr: "0.0.0.0/0"
  proxy-body-size: "20m"
  use-proxy-protocol: "true"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.1.1
    helm.sh/chart: ingress-nginx-4.0.16
  name: ingress-nginx-controller
  namespace: ingress-nginx
```

**NOTE** to use nginx ingress controller with the proxy protocol enabled, an external nginx instance is used as proxy (since OCI LB doesn't support proxy protocol at the moment). Nginx will be installed on each worker node and the configuation of nginx will:

* listen in proxy protocol mode
* forward the traffic from port 80 to nginx_ingress_controller_http_nodeport (default to 30080) on any server of the cluster
* forward the traffic from port 443 to nginx_ingress_controller_https_nodeport (default to 30443) on any server of the cluster

This is the final result:

Client -> Public L4 LB -> nginx proxy (with proxy protocol enabled) -> nginx ingress (with proxy protocol enabled) -> k3s service -> pod(s)

### Cert-manager

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is used to issue certificates from a variety of supported source. To use cert-manager take a look at [nginx-ingress-cert-manager.yml](deployments/nginx/nginx-ingress-cert-manager.yml) and [nginx-configmap-cert-manager.yml](deployments/nginx/nginx-configmap-cert-manager.yml) example. To use cert-manager and get the certificate you **need** set on your DNS configuration the public ip address of the load balancer.

## Deploy

We are now ready to deploy our infrastructure. First we ask terraform to plan the execution with:

```
terraform plan

...
...
      + id                             = (known after apply)
      + ip_addresses                   = (known after apply)
      + is_preserve_source_destination = false
      + is_private                     = true
      + lifecycle_details              = (known after apply)
      + nlb_ip_version                 = (known after apply)
      + state                          = (known after apply)
      + subnet_id                      = (known after apply)
      + system_tags                    = (known after apply)
      + time_created                   = (known after apply)
      + time_updated                   = (known after apply)

      + reserved_ips {
          + id = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 27 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + k3s_servers_ips = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]
  + k3s_workers_ips = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]
  + public_lb_ip    = (known after apply)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```

now we can deploy our resources with:

```
terraform apply

...
...
      + is_preserve_source_destination = false
      + is_private                     = true
      + lifecycle_details              = (known after apply)
      + nlb_ip_version                 = (known after apply)
      + state                          = (known after apply)
      + subnet_id                      = (known after apply)
      + system_tags                    = (known after apply)
      + time_created                   = (known after apply)
      + time_updated                   = (known after apply)

      + reserved_ips {
          + id = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 27 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + k3s_servers_ips = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]
  + k3s_workers_ips = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
    ]
  + public_lb_ip    = (known after apply)

Outputs:

k3s_servers_ips = [
  "X.X.X.X",
  "X.X.X.X",
]
k3s_workers_ips = [
  "X.X.X.X",
  "X.X.X.X",
]
public_lb_ip = tolist([
  "X.X.X.X",
])
```

Now on one master node you can check the status of the cluster with:

```
ssh X.X.X.X -lubuntu

ubuntu@inst-iwlqz-k3s-servers:~$ sudo su -
root@inst-iwlqz-k3s-servers:~# kubectl get nodes

```

#### Public LB check

We can now test the public load balancer, nginx ingress controller and the security list ingress rules. On your local PC run:

```
curl -v http://<PUBLIC_LB_IP>

*   Trying PUBLIC_LB_IP:80...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to PUBLIC_LB_IP (PUBLIC_LB_IP) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: PUBLIC_LB_IP
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>

</html>
* Connection #0 to host PUBLIC_LB_IP left intact
```

*404* is a correct response since the cluster is empty. We can test also the https listener/backends:

```
curl -k -v https://<PUBLIC_LB_IP>

* Trying PUBLIC_LB_IP:443...
* TCP_NODELAY set

#### Longhorn check

To check if longhorn was successfully installed run on one master nodes:

```
kubectl get ns

#### Argocd check

You can verify that all pods are running:
```
root@inst-hmgnl-k3s-servers:~# kubectl get pods -n argocd
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-application-controller-0                     1/1     Running   0          8m51s
argocd-applicationset-controller-7b74965f8c-mjl97   1/1     Running   0          8m53s
argocd-dex-server-7f75d56bc6-j62hb                  1/1     Running   0          8m53s
argocd-notifications-controller-54dd686846-lggrz    1/1     Running   0          8m53s
argocd-redis-5dff748d9c-s5q2l                       1/1     Running   0          8m52s
argocd-repo-server-5576f8d84b-sgbbt                 1/1     Running   0          8m52s
argocd-server-76cf7d4c7b-jq9qx                      1/1     Running   0          8m52s
```

To fetch the initial admin password, to be able to do this you need to expose your kubeapi-server (set *expose_kubeapi* variable to ture) and fetch the
kubeconfig from one of the server nodes, it will be in (/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig): 

```
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

To connect to the UI (make sure to copy the kubeconfig to your local machine first):

```
kubectl -n argocd port-forward service/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

After that you should be able to visit the ArgoCD UI: https://localhost:8080


## Deploy a sample stack

Finally to test all the components of the cluster we can deploy a sample stack. The stack is composed by the following components:

* MariaDB
* Nginx
* Wordpress

Each component is made by: one deployment and one service.
Wordpress and nginx share the same persistent volume (ReadWriteMany with longhorn storage class). The nginx configuration is stored in four ConfigMaps and  the nginx service is exposed by the nginx ingress controller.

Deploy the resources with:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/mariadb/all-resources.yml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/wordpress/all-resources.yml
```

**NOTE** The Wordpress installation is **secured**. To allow external traffic to /wp-admin, /xmlrpc.php and wp-login.php you have to edit the  [deployments/nginx/all-resources.yml](https://github.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/blob/master/deployments/nginx/all-resources.yml) and change this line:

```yaml
- name: SECURE_SUBNET
  value: 8.8.8.8/32 # change-me
```

whit your public ip address CIDR.

```
curl -o nginx-all-resources.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/nginx/all-resources.yml

vi nginx-all-resources.yml

change SECURE_SUBNET and save the file

kubectl apply -f nginx-all-resources.yml
```

now check the status:

```
kubectl get deployments
NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
mariadb       1/1     1            1           92m
nginx         1/1     1            1           79m
wordpress     1/1     1            1           91m

kubectl get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes        ClusterIP   10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    5h8m
mariadb-svc       ClusterIP   10.43.184.188   <none>        3306/TCP   92m
nginx-svc         ClusterIP   10.43.9.202     <none>        80/TCP     80m
wordpress-svc     ClusterIP   10.43.242.26    <none>        9000/TCP   91m
```

Now you are ready to setup WP, open the LB public ip and follow the wizard. **NOTE** nginx and the Kubernetes Ingress rule are configured without virthual host/server name.

![k3s wp install](https://garutilorenzo.github.io/images/k3s-wp.png?)

To clean the deployed resources:

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/mariadb/all-resources.yml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/nginx/all-resources.yml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garutilorenzo/k3s-oci-cluster/master/deployments/wordpress/all-resources.yml
```

## Clean up

```
terraform destroy
```

## Known Bugs

### 409-Conflict

If you see this error during the infrastructure destruction:

```
Error: 409-Conflict, Invalid State Transition of NLB lifeCycle state from Updating to Updating
│ Suggestion: The resource is in a conflicted state. Please retry again or contact support for help with service: Network Load Balancer Listener

re-run *terraform destroy*

### kubectl exec failure

The runc version in k3s containerd version 1.6.6 contains a regression that prevents anyone from executing a command and attaching to the container's TTY (exec -it) whenever someone runs systemctl daemon-reload. Alternatively, the user may run into this issue on SELinux-enforced systems. [Ref](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/6064).

```
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system cilium-6lqp9 -- cilium status
Defaulted container "cilium-agent" out of: cilium-agent, mount-cgroup (init), apply-sysctl-overwrites (init), mount-bpf-fs (init), wait-for-node-init (init), clean-cilium-state (init)
error: Internal error occurred: error executing command in container: failed to exec in container: failed to start exec "b67e6e00172071996430dac5c97352e4d0c9fa3b3888e8daece5197c4649b4d1": OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: open /dev/pts/0: operation not permitted: unknown
```

To solve this issue downgrade to k3s v1.23
